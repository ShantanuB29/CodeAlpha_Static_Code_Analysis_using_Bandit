# CodeAlpha_Static_Code_Analysis_using_Bandit
This project incorporates static code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase. We leverage the Bandit tool, a Python static analyzer, to scan for common security issues like insecure direct object references, hardcoded credentials, and suspicious function calls.
Running Bandit regularly helps us maintain a secure codebase by catching these issues early in the development process.
