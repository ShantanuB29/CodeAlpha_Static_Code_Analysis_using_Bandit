# CodeAlpha_Static_Code_Analysis_using_Bandit
This project incorporates static code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase. We leverage the Bandit tool, a Python static analyzer, to scan for common security issues like insecure direct object references, hardcoded credentials, and suspicious function calls.
Running Bandit regularly helps us maintain a secure codebase by catching these issues early in the development process.

Step 1: Install Bandit

You can install Bandit using pip, which is a package manager for Python. Open your terminal and run the following command:

pip install bandit


Step 2: Run Bandit

Now you can run Bandit on your Python files. 


By the following command, you can run Bandit
bandit -r [filename] -h [output file type] -o[output filename]
-r or --recursive: This tells Bandit to find and scan all Python files in the current directory and all its subdirectories.
-h or --help: This displays a help message with information about how to use Bandit and what the different options do.
-o or --output: This tells Bandit to write the report to a file instead of printing it to the console2. You need to specify the filename or path where you want the report to be saved.
